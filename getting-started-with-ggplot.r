In this case, I'm going to add a scatter plot layer.\n\n3. ```geom_point()```: This function adds a scatter plot layer to the ggplot object. It tells ggplot to create a scatter plot with points.\n\n4. ```mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)```: Within the ```geom_point()``` function, I use the ```aes()``` (aesthetic) function to map variables to aesthetics of the plot. Here, I am specifying that the x-axis should represent the ```\"flipper_length_mm\"``` variable from your dataset, and the y-axis should represent the ```\"body_mass_g\"``` variable. This means that the flipper length will be on the x-axis, and body mass will be on the y-axis.\n\nWhen I run this code, it generates a scatter plot for me. Each point on the plot represents a penguin's flipper length on the x-axis and body mass on the y-axis. This allows me to visually explore any relationships or patterns between flipper length and body mass in the penguin dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To summarize on how to create a plot, I follow these three steps:\n1. Start with the ```ggplot``` function and choose a dataset to work with\n2. Add a ```geom_function``` to display your data\n3.

To make a plot, replace the bracketed sections in the code with a dataset, a geom_function, or a group of aesthetic mappings. I can make all kinds of different plots using this template.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(data=penguins)+\n    geom_point(mapping=aes(x=culmen_length_mm,y=culmen_depth_mm))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-21T07:48:41.278799Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-21T07:48:41.280850Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-21T07:48:41.599126Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this next example, I change the x-axis and y-axis to the penguins' culmen length and its depth to understand the relationship between these two.
